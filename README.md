## Tech things

### Languages
Layouts were made in **XML** with Android "Layout" components, the whole project is developed in **Kotlin**. 

### Compatibility
The minimum needed version to execute the app is Android Lollipop 5.1 (API 22), anyway, we recommend to use the most recent version of Android, the majority of our tests having been carried out on Android 10 & 11 (API 29 & 30).

### Cache
We use [Realm.io](https://realm.io/) on both platforms (iOS and Android) to store the offline data of files, shares, app and user preferences (in different databases instances). [Android Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) is used to store API access token and basic user data.

### Structure
The structure of the app, its algorithms and the general functioning are common with the iOS app.
